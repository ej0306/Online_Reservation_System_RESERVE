# Reservation System

This is a README file for the Reservation System project. Before opening the Admin file, please follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites

- XAMPP or a similar local development environment is set up on your computer.

## Installation

1. Open your preferred web browser and navigate to `localhost/phpmyadmin` (for Windows) or `localhost:8080/phpmyadmin` (for Mac).
2. Click on the toolbar labeled "Database".
3. Create a new database called "reservation".
4. Look for the toolbar labeled "Import" and import the SQL file named "reservation.sql".
5. Open the terminal in XAMPP and create a new database called "reservation_made".
   - Note: Importing the file named "reservation_made.sql" using phpMyAdmin will not work.
6. Once the database is created, manually create a table called "reservation_made".
   - Note: Alternatively, you can copy the content from the text file located at `Admin/db/reservation_made.sql`.
7. Make sure everything is set up correctly, and then go to `localhost/Admin/index.php`.

## User Credentials

To access the user part of the system, the file `mysqli_connectReservation.php` is used to connect to the databases. The variable `@dbc` in this file enables the connection using a private MySQL username and password instead of the default "root" user. Therefore, you will need to use your own MySQL username and password instead of the ones used in the `mysqli_connectReservation.php` file.

- Username: admin
- Password: 123

Now you are ready to use the Reservation System.
