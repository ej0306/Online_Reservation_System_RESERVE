Before Opening the Admin file. You should follow these steps.

1. Go to localhost/phpmyadmin (for Windows)
	- localhost:8080/phpmyadmin (for Mac)

2. Click the toolbar “Database”
3. Create new database called “reservation”
4. Look for the toolbar called “Import” and import the sql file called “reservation”

5. Open terminal on xammp and create a new database called “reservation_made”. 
	*NOTE: importing the file caled “reservation_made” using phpmyadmin will not work.

6. Once database is created, manually create a table called “reservation_made”.
	*NOTE: could also copy the text file. It can be found inside Admin/db/reservation_made.sql

7. Once everything is set go to localhost/Admin/index.php

8- The user part uses mysqli_connectReservation.php to connect to the databases. The variable @dbc which enables the connection use a private MYSQL username and password instead of root so  you are going to have to use your mysql username and password instead of the one used in the file  mysqli_connectReservation.php
